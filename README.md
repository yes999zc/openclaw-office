# OpenClaw Office

> [中文文档](./README.zh.md)

> Visualize AI agent collaboration as a real-time digital twin office.

**OpenClaw Office** is the visual monitoring and management frontend for the [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) Multi-Agent system. It renders Agent work status, collaboration links, tool calls, and resource consumption through an isometric-style virtual office scene, along with a full-featured console for system management.

**Core Metaphor:** Agent = Digital Employee | Office = Agent Runtime | Desk = Session | Meeting Pod = Collaboration Context

---

## Features

### Virtual Office

- **2D Floor Plan** — SVG-rendered isometric office with desk zones, hot desks, meeting areas, and rich furniture (desks, chairs, sofas, plants, coffee cups)
- **3D Scene** — React Three Fiber 3D office with character models, skill holograms, spawn portal effects, and post-processing
- **Agent Avatars** — Deterministically generated SVG avatars from agent IDs with real-time status animations (idle, working, speaking, tool calling, error)
- **Collaboration Lines** — Visual connections showing inter-Agent message flow
- **Speech Bubbles** — Live Markdown text streaming and tool call display
- **Side Panels** — Agent details, Token line charts, cost pie charts, activity heatmaps, SubAgent relationship graphs, event timelines

### Chat

- Bottom-docked chat bar for real-time conversations with Agents
- Agent selector, streaming message display, Markdown rendering
- Chat history drawer with timeline view

---

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 22+**
- **pnpm** (package manager)
- **[OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw)** installed and configured

OpenClaw Office is a companion frontend that connects to a running OpenClaw Gateway. It does **not** start or manage the Gateway itself.

---

## Quick Launch

The fastest way to run OpenClaw Office — no cloning required:

```bash
# Run directly (one-time)
npx @ww-ai-lab/openclaw-office

# Or install globally
npm install -g @ww-ai-lab/openclaw-office
openclaw-office
```

The server starts on `http://localhost:5180` by default. Customize with environment variables:

```bash
PORT=3000 openclaw-office          # Use a custom port
HOST=127.0.0.1 openclaw-office     # Bind to localhost only
```

> **Note:** This serves the pre-built production bundle. For development with hot reload, see [Development](#development) below.

---

## Quick Start (from source)

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 2. Configure Gateway Connection

Create a `.env.local` file (gitignored) with your Gateway connection details:

```bash
cat > .env.local << 'EOF'
VITE_GATEWAY_URL=ws://localhost:18789
VITE_GATEWAY_TOKEN=<your-gateway-token>
EOF
```

Get your Gateway token:

```bash
openclaw config get gateway.auth.token
```

### 3. Enable Device Auth Bypass (Required)

OpenClaw Office is a pure web application and cannot provide Ed25519 device identity signatures that Gateway 2026.2.15+ requires for operator scopes. You must configure the Gateway to bypass this requirement:

```bash
openclaw config set gateway.controlUi.dangerouslyDisableDeviceAuth true
```

**Restart the Gateway** after this configuration change.

> **Security Note:** This bypass is intended for local development. In production, use a reverse proxy or other secure authentication mechanism.

### 4. Start the Gateway

Ensure the OpenClaw Gateway is running on the configured address (default `localhost:18789`). You can start it via:

- The OpenClaw macOS app
- `openclaw gateway run` CLI command
- Other deployment methods (see [OpenClaw documentation](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw))

### 5. Start the Dev Server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5180` in your browser.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `VITE_GATEWAY_URL` | No | `ws://localhost:18789` | Gateway WebSocket address |
| `VITE_GATEWAY_TOKEN` | Yes (when connecting to real Gateway) | — | Gateway auth token |
| `VITE_MOCK` | No | `false` | Enable mock mode (no Gateway needed) |

### Mock Mode (No Gateway)

To develop without a running Gateway, enable mock mode:

```bash
VITE_MOCK=true pnpm dev
```

This uses simulated Agent data for UI development.

## Development

### Commands

```bash
pnpm install              # Install dependencies
pnpm dev                  # Start dev server (port 5180)
pnpm build                # Production build
pnpm test                 # Run tests
pnpm test:watch           # Test watch mode
pnpm typecheck            # TypeScript type check
pnpm lint                 # Oxlint linting
pnpm format               # Oxfmt formatting
pnpm check                # lint + format check
```

### Architecture

OpenClaw Office connects to the Gateway via WebSocket and follows this data flow:

```
OpenClaw Gateway  ──WebSocket──>  ws-client.ts  ──>  event-parser.ts  ──>  Zustand Store  ──>  React Components
     │                                                                          │
     └── RPC (agents.list, chat.send, ...)  ──>  rpc-client.ts  ──────────────>─┘
```

The Gateway broadcasts real-time events (`agent`, `presence`, `health`, `heartbeat`) and responds to RPC requests. The frontend maps Agent lifecycle events to visual states (idle, working, speaking, tool_calling, error) and renders them in the office scene.
